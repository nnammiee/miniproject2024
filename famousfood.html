            <h2 class="text">CARABEEF</h2>
            <p class="card-text">
                Dishes with carabao meat are quite prevalent in Tuguegarao with locals considering it a staple in their protein diet. Meals with carabao meat often include carabeef longganisa or carabeef tapa (dried or cured meat). Some eateries and restaurants also incorporate carabeef into papaitan, which is an Ilocano broth made from goat or cow innards. Papaitan originates from the word “pait” or bitter, which is the prevailing taste of the soup dish due to bile from the innards.

            <h2 class="text">CARABAO MILK</h2>
            <p class="card-text">
                One of the city’s most well-known products is carabao milk candy, which is, of course, made from carabao milk. These thin, rectangular candies have a sweet and powdery aftertaste, giving them a distinct flavor. Aside from candies, carabao milk is also used in pastillas de leche, a common Filipino dessert and snack. You can find carabao milk pastillas and candies at most pasalubong shops, markets, and bus terminals in Tuguegarao.

            <h2 class="text">CHICHARABAO</h2>
            <p class="card-text">
                Chicharabao or carabao chicharon is a popular local snack that comes in small packs. This crackling, unlike most chicharon products, is made from carabao skin. Chicharabao is more puffy, airy, and crisp, and it often comes with a small container of vinegar. Besides being a typical souvenir item, chicharabao is also used as pulutan or a beer pairing snack. Chicharabao usually comes in regular, spicy, and garlic flavors.

            <h2 class="text">KAKANIN</h2>
            <p class="card-text">
                Suman, a traditional Filipino kakanin or snack made from sticky rice, is largely prevalent in the Ilocos region. Most provinces have their own take on the suman, and Cagayan is no different. While in Tuguegarao, check out the region’s kakanin offerings such as pawa, which is sweetened ground rice with peanut fillings housed in steamed buns. There’s also the tinubong and sinabalu, which are sweet, sticky  rice cakes encased in bamboo.
