                    <li>Tuguegarao was founded as a mission center by Dominican Fr. Jacinto Pardo on May 9, 1604.</li>
                    <li>It was made the capital of the province in 1841.</li>
                    <li>On December 12, 1899, U.S. troops under Bachelor entered the town and Col. Hood was appointed military governor.</li>
                    <li>On December 12, 1941, during World War II, Tuguegarao was occupied by the Japanese.</li>
                    <li>U.S. Air Force planes began bombing it in December 1944, reducing it to complete rubble.</li>
                    <li>It was officially liberated on June 25, 1945.</li>
                    <li>On December 18, 1999 Tuguegarao was made into a component city by virtue of Republic Act No. 8255.</li>
                    <li>The city’s name was derived from either of the following: garao (“swift river current”), taraw (a specie of palm tree) and tuggui gari yao (“this was cleared by fire”). The last is the plausible of the three.  A kaingin may have been pointed to by the natives to the first Spanish arrivals.</li>
